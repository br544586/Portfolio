	<h1>About Bianca Roelandschap</h1>
	<br>
	<div class="container">
	<p>My name is Bianca Roelandschap, I was born in 1975 in Utrecht, the Netherlands. I lived with my parents, older sister and brother in Nieuwegein.</p>
	<p>I didn't have an easy childhood. My parents got devorced when I was 11.</p>
	<p>Back in that time, it was unusual to have parents who got devorced, so I was bullied a lot at school.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>I was sexually abused right after my parents were devorced by a "friend of the family", who was kind to me. And made me feel like I was someone.</p>
	<p>Why am I telling you this? Well my story is one of milions in this world, and instead of feeling sorry for myself, I made (and still am making) something of my life! Never the less, this should not happen to anyone (children or adults).</p>
	<p>So, if I could change just one thing in this world, it would be the way people treat each other. If it's because your black, a woman, gay, or anything other than what people know and trust, there is no reason what so ever to abuse someone!</p>
	<p>Like I said, i made something of my life. Sinds I was just a little girl, I wanted to be a mother when I grew up. So after Edwin and I got married in 1999, we tried to get pregnant.</p>
	<p>Unfortunatly after being pregnant for 13 weeks, we got a miscarriage. We were devasstated.</p>
	<p>I was scared to try again, but we did. Our son Nigel was born in 2003!</p>
	<p>When I was giving birth, I had some complications. So I was brought to de OR. It was very scary, espescialy for Edwin, because he was left holding our son.</p>
	<p>Well I'm still here, so I made it out. But I was told I could never have any children again without the change that things could go wrong, and I would die giving birth. So we decided not to have anymore children.</p>
	<p>We still live in Nieuwegein, in the Netherlands.</p>
