		<p>When I was younger I started to make websites, buildiing them with Lycos and later on with Joomla! and WordPress.</p>
		<p>This is my first website build from scratch, so there are not much projects yet.</p>
		<p>During the course of Web Development that I am taking, I will be filling this page with other projects that I need to do.</p>
		<p>But if you want to look at other projects that I have built before the Web Development course, take a look at the <a title="OHSN - Projecten" href="https://www.ohsn.nl/projecten" target="_blank">projects page on OHSN</a>.</p>
