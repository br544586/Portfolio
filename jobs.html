	<h1>My Jobs</h1>
	<br>
	<div class="container">
	<p>I started my career working in a factory when I was 16 years old. I had no education because I dropped out.</p>
<p>After working there for a year, I started working at a recruitment agency doing the administration. I learned so much there (I will always be thankfull), not just about the job, but also about myself!</p>
<p>Unfortunatly they could't keep me employed, so I dit a few other jobs before I started my current one.</p>
<p>In 2001 I started working in a hospital, at the technical services department. Just doing the administration at first. Learning everything there is to know. A hospital is a realy dynamic workplace, so I never had the idea that I stood still.</p>
<p>But in 2008 I saw that my work changed a lot over the years. Not always in a good matter. So I asked to get some more tasks that I could do, besides the job I was already doing.</p>
<p>So in 2009 I completed a course alowing me to become a functional application manager for the system we were using registring the jobs for the technicians.</p>
<p>In 2014 our department started to expand, other departments were added to our department. And my task as functional application manager grew out to be a full-time job.</p>
<p>Till this day, I am still doing this job. And I love it!</p>
<p>I love this job, because I get to create new things in our system, that will make the job of my colleagues easier and more fun.</p>
<p>But, I am not one to stand still, so in 2021 I decided to take a Web Development course. When I was younger I started to make websites in my spare time. First using Lycos, later with Joomla! and WordPress. But I wanted more.</p>
<p>I wanted to make beautifull websites from scratch. Learning to create something, with just an idea in my head.</p>
<p>This website is my first website made from scrach. So be gentle!</p>
